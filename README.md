 Data Analysis and Manipulation
### Project Overview: Python Data Manipulation and Analysis

This project aims to demonstrate various data manipulation and analysis tasks using Python. It involves working with Excel datasets, cleaning and organizing data, web scraping, and performing text analysis tasks such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Additionally, it includes automating email tasks and converting image files to Excel format.

### Tasks Overview:

1. **Organizing Duplicates in Excel:**
    - Task 1a: Arrange duplicates in the "names" column at the top.
    - Task 1b: Arrange duplicates in the "email" column at the top.
    - Task 1c: Arrange duplicates in the "phone 1", "phone 2", "phone 3", "phone 4" columns at the top.
    - Task 1d: Arrange duplicates in the "URL" column at the top.

2. **Cleaning Database and Creating a Website:**
    - Clean and organize a database containing duplicates, ensuring one entry per person, relevant information retention, and phone numbers consolidation.
    - Create a small website (Address Book/ Contact Book) to display the cleaned contacts.

3. **Automating Personalized Emails:**
    - Write a script to automate sending 20 personalized emails each day to people from the database.

4. **Web Scraping:**
    - Write a script to scrape data from two websites:
        - https://business.abidjan.net/annonces-legales (100 notices of constitution)
        - https://tribunalcommerceabidjan.org/ (100 PDF documents)

5. **Text Analysis:**
    - Task 5: Perform topic modeling on a dataset.
    - Task 6: Perform sentiment analysis on a dataset.

6. **Image Conversion:**
    - Convert JPG files to Excel files.

### Repository Structure:

- **Scripts:** Contains Python scripts for each task.
- **Datasets:** Contains input Excel files for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Results:** Contains output files generated from the scripts.
- **README.md:** Provides instructions and explanations for each task.
